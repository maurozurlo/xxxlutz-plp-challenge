This is my Product list project for XXXLutz tech challenge. I tried to keep it as straight forward as possible, using Create React App and only two additional dependencies (node-sass & react-intersection-observer).

I tried to keep the styling similar to the XXXLutz website and used a combination of css and scss variables where I saw fit.

All components are functional components and for global state I used React's native useContext.
I tend to find Redux and other libraries a bit too boilerplate heavy.

Design responsiveness has been tested on a desktop pc, a mobile phone and an iPad.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the TypeScript template.

Package-Lock file was generated using Node v15.14 & NPM 7.7.6

The first step to run this project would be to run the `npm ci` command to install all dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
